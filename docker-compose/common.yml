#The common.yml has the common network driver type. When we run a compose file we include this common file,
#  so it will set the network type as bridge.
#In docker terminology, a bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the same bridge
#  network to communicate while preventing other containers to reach the network.
#Containers from different bridge networks can not communicate directly with each other, since the bridge driver
#  creates rules to prevent this communication.If you don't set a bridge network, a default network will be created.
#  And on the default bridge network, containers can only access each other by IP addresses by default. But with a
# user defined bridge network, containers can be resolved using hostnames, which is more handy to use instead of IP
# addresses, because IP has a dynamic structure and can change in time.
